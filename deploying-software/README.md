# Deploying Software

Scientific software -- typically scripts written in bash, python or R -- are 
often written on the developers desktop machine and then need to be deployed
to another machine which may have different file paths for executables or data.

Documents in this directory capture a set of practices and suggestions used by 
[Mazama Science](http://mazamascienc.com) during the process of _operationalizing_
scientific software.

* [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md) -- How to use environment
variables to customize file paths on a per-system basis.
